# Dementia Predictor

## This Dementia predictor is my first website made using Machine Learning 

## Introduction
Dementia is a broad term used to describe a range of cognitive impairments that interfere with an individual's daily functioning and quality of life. It is characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities such as memory, problem-solving, language, and the ability to perform familiar tasks. Dementia is often associated with aging, but it is not a normal part of the aging process. It can be caused by various underlying conditions, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common cause.

## About Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML techniques have found valuable applications in the field of healthcare, including the prediction and diagnosis of diseases like dementia.

## Dementia Predictor Application
